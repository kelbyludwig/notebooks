Using standard rewinding techniques, one can obtain from a successful prover commitment and response messages for different challenge messages but the same commitment messages...\n",

The blog post calls this algorithm the \"Extractor\". This algorithm under \"normal\" circumstances shouldn't be possible (otherwise the protocol would just be trivially broken!). However, the proof used in this blog post relies on the \"Extractor\" being able to stop a ZKP protocol run mid-protocol and \"rewind\" the prover's state. The extractor defined in the \"Illustrated Primer, Part 2\" blog post for Schnorr's Identification scheme is very similar to the proofs used in \"Direct Anonymous Attestation Explained\"!"
